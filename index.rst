  Iâ€™m Poppy Woodstock.
Romance author and wholehearted believer in Happily Ever Afters.
A terminal case of writerâ€™s block should be my biggest worry.

Then I crash into himâ€”literallyâ€”and fall into the most gorgeous pair of blue eyes Iâ€™ve ever seen.

Connor Bradley.
Thief, rebelâ€¦ and my new neighbor.
One slip with the bad boy next door, and my life becomes stranger than any fiction I could ever write.

I impulsively tell his mother that Iâ€™m his fiancÃ©e, forcing him to help me.
And for some reason, he willingly takes my problems onto his broad shoulders, growling at anyone who stands in my way to meet my deadline.

He turns my world upside down, sparks my inspiration, and claims my body in ways Iâ€™ve never dreamed possible.
Through it all, I have to wonderâ€¦

Do Happily Ever After endings exist in real life?

One Day Fiance is a full length romantic comedy. It is a complete standalone.
